# Shop Management App

### What will the project do?

This project is designed to help users manage their shops by allowing them to add new items, update their quantities,
upload their pictures, and track sales. The project also includes features for setting inventory limits and sending 
notifications when inventory levels fall below the set limit. 

 You can begin adding items to your inventory by providing a name, quantity, picture, and type for each item. You can
 also update the quantities of existing items and track sales by subtracting the quantity sold from the total inventory.
You can set an inventory limit for each item by going to the inventory tab and selecting the item you want to set a 
limit for. If the inventory level falls below the set limit, the system will send a notification to the user. It can
also generate summary of sales so users can do analysis on their business



### Who will use it?

Potential users of this project could include 


- small business owners
- store managers
- individuals who sell goods through a physical or online shop
- Any seller who does not have their own inventory managing systems. 


This project would be 
particularly useful for any individual or businesses that have a physical storefront and need to track inventory levels and sales,as well
as businesses that sell goods online and need to keep track of inventory and shipping.
 
### Why I am Interested in this project?

I am interested in this project because it allows me to apply my knowledge of business and computer science to create a 
valuable tool for small business owners and entrepreneurs. As a BUCS student, I am particularly excited about the 
opportunity to combine my interests in technology and business to create a solution that can help businesses run 
more efficiently and effectively. Additionally, my dad's experience as a business owner has given me a firsthand
understanding of the challenges that businesses face when it comes to managing inventory and tracking sales. 
This has motivated me to choose this as my project.
